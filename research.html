    During my undergraduate in physics I have been involved in a number of research projects, ranging over a number of fields in physics, including classical mechanics, thermodynamics, and nuclear physics.
    At the moment, I am primarily interested in hadronic physics and QCD.
    The sections below summarize some more specific information relating to these interests as well as some projects I have been involved in.
    Additionally, there is a sections describing my previous projects along with publications, posters, and presentations I have prepared relating to these.

        <h2 class="section">Hadronic and Nuclear Stucture</h2>
        <p>
        Nuclear matter is anything made up of protons and neutrons.
        During the 20th century, it became readily apparent that our picture of these nucleons as fundamental particles is inaccurate of reality.
        Indeed, a model of hadronic matter, encompassing nuclear matter, composed of quarks with gluons, which are the gauge bosons in QCD and mediate the strong nuclear force, binding together these hadrons.
        As with anything that is not fundamental, there is an impetus to understand the emergent global properties arising from the behavior of its constituents.
        This is certainly true in the field of nuclear physics.
        A few open problems that I have been exposed to and found intriguing are discussed below.

        <h3 class="subsection">Collinear Factorization and Parton Distribution Functions</h3>
        <p>
            QCD is an inherently nonperturbative theory, but in some kinematic regions accessible at particle accelerators and colliders, we can factorize the hadronic physics in terms of a hard scattering part, where we can imagine that interactions with the proton occur with a quark or gluon moving collinearly with the nucleon, and quantum correlation functions.
            In particular, the simplest quantum correlation functions that capture the longitudinal structure of nucleons are the so-called parton distribution functions (PDFs).
            An interpretation of these functions is somewhat difficult.
            To first order, at least for unpolarized scattering experiments, we can interpret these PDFs as probability distributions for the different quark flavors to be found carrying a particular momentum fraction \(x\).
